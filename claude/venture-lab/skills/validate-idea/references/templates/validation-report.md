## Revenue Model Scenarios

> These are qualitative projections based on market evidence, competitor data, and reasonable assumptions. They are not financial forecasts.

### Bull Case

**Scenario:** {Describe the optimistic-but-plausible scenario. What conditions lead to strong revenue?}

## Go/No-Go Recommendation

**Recommendation:** {Go | No-Go | Conditional Go}
**Confidence Level:** {High | Medium | Low}

### Reasoning

{2-3 paragraphs explaining the recommendation. Address the following:
- What evidence supports this recommendation?
- What are the strongest arguments for and against pursuing this idea?
- Why was this confidence level assigned?
- If Conditional Go: what specific conditions must be met before committing?}

### Confidence Level Criteria

<!-- This section explains the confidence assessment. Keep the criteria that apply. -->

- **High confidence:** Multiple independent data sources confirm the assessment. Competitor landscape is well-understood. Demand signals are strong and consistent.
- **Medium confidence:** Some data gaps exist but core conclusions are supported by available evidence. Key assumptions are reasonable but unverified.
- **Low confidence:** Significant data gaps limit the reliability of this assessment. Key conclusions rely on indirect evidence or limited sources. Additional research is recommended before acting on this recommendation.

<!-- State which criteria drove the confidence level: -->

**Confidence drivers:** {Explain what factors raised or lowered confidence, e.g., "Confidence is Medium because competitor pricing data was well-documented but customer acquisition costs could not be verified."}

## Data Gaps and Limitations

> This section documents what information was sought but not found, and how these gaps affect the reliability of this validation.

### Information Unavailable

- {Data gap 1: e.g., "No reliable customer acquisition cost data was found for this market segment."}
- {Data gap 2: e.g., "Competitor revenue figures are not publicly available; market share estimates are inferred from web traffic proxies."}
- {Data gap 3: e.g., "Limited user feedback data; no public reviews or forum discussions were found for the primary competitor."}

### Impact on Validation

{1-2 sentences describing how the data gaps affect the overall validation. e.g., "The absence of customer acquisition cost data introduces uncertainty in the bull case revenue scenario. The go/no-go recommendation accounts for this uncertainty in the confidence level."}

### Recommended Follow-Up Research

- {Follow-up 1: e.g., "Conduct customer interviews with {N} potential users to validate willingness to pay."}
- {Follow-up 2: e.g., "Monitor {competitor} pricing changes over the next 3 months."}
- {Follow-up 3: e.g., "Search for industry reports on {specific topic} that may not be freely accessible."}
