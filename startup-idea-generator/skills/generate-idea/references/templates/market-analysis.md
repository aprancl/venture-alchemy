## Market Size Estimates

> Estimates use qualitative language grounded in available evidence. These are directional indicators, not financial projections.

- **TAM** (Total Addressable Market): {Qualitative description of the broad market scope, e.g., "Large -- millions of potential users globally across all segments" or "Niche -- tens of thousands of professionals in a specialized field." Cite source or reasoning.}
- **SAM** (Serviceable Addressable Market): {The segment a solo developer could realistically target, e.g., "Mid-size -- English-speaking freelancers in creative industries who currently use manual processes." Describe scope narrowing and reasoning.}
- **SOM** (Serviceable Obtainable Market): {What a solo developer could realistically capture in 12-24 months, e.g., "Small -- a few hundred paying users via organic channels, translating to a lifestyle-business level of revenue." Be honest and conservative.}

**Estimation basis:** {Explain how these estimates were derived. Reference industry reports, competitor user counts, adjacent market data, or community size. If data is sparse, state that explicitly.}

<!-- If market size data is unavailable or highly uncertain, use this block: -->

> **Limited Data:** Reliable market size data was not found for this niche. The estimates above are inferred from {adjacent market / competitor signals / community size / general reasoning}. Treat these as directional only. Running `/validate-idea` on ideas in this market is strongly recommended.
